# Python Fundamentals for QA Automation

This repository contains foundational Python scripts I'm developing as part of my Test Automation University learning path. These examples are intended to reinforce core programming concepts essential for building automation frameworks in real-world QA environments.

## üß† Topics Covered

- **Variables** and basic data types
- **Functions**, positional and keyword arguments
- **Conditionals** (`if/else`) and **loops** (`for`, `while`)
- **Lists** and **dictionaries**
- Basic **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP): classes, inheritance

Each file focuses on a specific concept and includes examples and small practice exercises.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm Elias Schepis, QA Automation Engineer with 4+ years of experience at Accenture. I'm currently transitioning to Python-based automation to strengthen my skills and broaden my opportunities in the European tech market. This repository is part of my upskilling journey.
